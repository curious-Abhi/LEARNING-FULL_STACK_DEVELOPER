# JavaScript Basics

This repository contains examples of fundamental JavaScript concepts such as control statements, operators, switch case, logical operators, loops, and arrays.

## Control Statements

Control statements like if-else conditionals, nested if statements, and if-else-if chains are demonstrated. These statements are essential for executing different blocks of code based on specified conditions.

## Ternary Operator

The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a concise way to write conditional expressions in JavaScript. It evaluates a condition and returns one of two expressions based on whether the condition is true or false.

## Switch Case

The switch statement provides a way to execute different code blocks based on different conditions. It evaluates an expression and compares it with multiple cases. When a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators such as AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!) are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. These operators are crucial for combining and manipulating conditions.

## Challenge: Test Score Evaluation

A challenge is provided to evaluate test scores and provide feedback using switch case statements. Grades are assigned based on the test scores, demonstrating practical usage of switch case.

## Operators

Various types of operators in JavaScript, including arithmetic, assignment, and comparison operators, are explained with examples. Understanding operators is essential for performing different types of operations in JavaScript.

## Loops

Different types of loops, including for loops, while loops, do-while loops, and for...in loops, are demonstrated. Loops are used for executing a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met.

## Arrays

Arrays in JavaScript are versatile data structures that can store multiple values of different types. Examples illustrate array creation, modification, accessing elements, and array methods for adding, removing, and manipulating elements.

## Intermediate Array Techniques

Intermediate array techniques such as spreading arrays, removing elements using splice(), slicing arrays, concatenating arrays, and mapping arrays are demonstrated. These techniques are useful for working with arrays efficiently.

## Additional Concepts

Additional concepts such as adding elements and intermediate array techniques are covered. These concepts provide more insight into working with arrays and manipulating array data effectively.

## Next Steps

Explore each concept further by reviewing the examples provided and experimenting with your own code. Understanding these fundamental JavaScript concepts is crucial for building more complex applications and mastering JavaScript development.
