# Command Line Techniques and Directory Navigation:

**Explanation:** Command line interfaces (CLI) provide powerful tools for interacting with your computer's file system and executing commands. Directory navigation involves moving between different directories or folders within the file system.

**How to Explain:** Start by introducing the concept of CLI as a text-based interface where users can input commands to perform tasks. Discuss basic commands like `cd` (change directory), `ls` (list files), and `pwd` (print working directory). Demonstrate how users can navigate through directories using these commands.

# Creating, Opening, and Removing Files through the Command Line:

**Explanation:** CLI allows users to create new files, open existing files, and remove unwanted files directly from the command line interface.

**How to Explain:** Begin by explaining how to create a new file using the `touch` command (on Unix-based systems) or `New-Item` command (on Windows). Show how to open a file using the appropriate command-line text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `notepad`). Then, demonstrate file removal using the `rm` command (on Unix-based systems) or `Remove-Item` command (on Windows).
