# Introduction to HTML

## What is HTML?

HTML stands for **H**yper**t**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. It is the most basic building block of the Web. It describes and defines the content of a webpage along with the basic layout of the webpage. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a webpage's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

## What is the DOM?

The DOM stands for **D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel. It is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them you can change the document's structure, style, or content. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them, and once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.

## What is a Web Browser?

A web browser is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. When you enter a URL (web address) in the address bar of your web browser and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, the browser will retrieve the web page from the server and display it on your screen. The browser reads the HTML document and displays it on the screen.

## What is a Web Server?

A web server is a computer system that processes requests via HTTP, the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the World Wide Web. The term can refer to the entire system, or specifically to the software that accepts requests and returns responses. The most common type of web server is the HTTP server, which listens for requests on a specific TCP port (usually 80) and returns the appropriate HTTP response.

## What is a Web Page?

A web page is a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web and displayed in a web browser. A web page may contain text, images, videos, games, or other multimedia content. A web page is identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which may be a simple address like example.com, or a complex address like example.com/subdirectory/file.html.

## What is a Web Address?

A web address is a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that identifies a resource on the World Wide Web. A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which is a string of characters used to identify a name or a resource.

## What is a Domain Name?

A domain name is a unique name that identifies an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a computer, a server, or a network. Domain names are used in URLs to identify particular Web pages. For example, the domain name "example.com" identifies the website of the company Example, Inc.

## What is a Web Host?

A web host is a service that provides the technologies and services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed in the Internet. Websites are hosted, or stored, on special computers called servers. When Internet users want to view your website, all they need to do is type your website address or domain into their browser. Their computer will then connect to your server and your web pages will be delivered to them through the browser.


## What is a Web Site?

A website is a collection of web pages that are linked together by a common domain name. Web pages are files that contain codes, texts, images, videos and other elements that display information on the internet. To view a website, you need a web browser and an internet connection. The web browser sends a request for a web page to a web server, which is a computer that stores and delivers web pages. The web server responds by sending back the requested web page to the web browser, which then interprets the codes and displays the information on your screen.

## What is a Web Application?

A web application is a software application that is accessed over a network, such as the Internet or an intranet. Web applications are often client-server applications, where the client (or user interface) runs in a web browser. Common web applications include webmail, online retail sales, online auctions, wikis, instant messaging services and many other functions.

A web service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. It has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically WSDL). Other systems interact with the web service in a manner prescribed by its description using SOAP-messages, typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML serialization in conjunction with other web-related standards.
