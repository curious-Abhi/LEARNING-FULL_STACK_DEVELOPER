## Introduction to APIs Learning Module

Welcome to my Introduction to APIs learning repository! This module is specifically designed to help you, as a learner, grasp the fundamentals of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and their role in software development.

## What Will You Learn?

Throughout this , you will dive into various aspects of APIs, including:

- Structuring API Requests
- Understanding JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- Making Server-Side API Requests with Axios
- Exploring API Authentication Methods
- Discovering REST APIs
- Building a Secrets Project

### 1. Structuring API Requests

Learn how to structure API requests, including HTTP methods, request headers, and query parameters.

### 2. What is JSON?

Explore JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a common data format used in APIs, and learn how to work with JSON data in your applications.

### 3. Making Server-Side API Requests with Axios

Discover how to use Axios, a popular JavaScript library, to make server-side API requests and handle responses asynchronously.

### 4. API Authentication

Understand the importance of API authentication and explore different authentication methods such as API keys, OAuth, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

### 5. REST APIs

Learn about REST (Representational State Transfer), a widely adopted architectural style for designing networked applications, and how to create, retrieve, update, and delete resources using RESTful APIs.

### 6. Secrets Project

Apply the concepts learned throughout the course by working on the Secrets Project, where you will build a secure web application that allows users to share secrets anonymously.
